# European Options Pricing and Risk Management Using AI-Driven Models and Traditional Numerical Methods
## 1. Project Overview

The aim of this project is to develop a comprehensive solution for pricing European options and managing associated financial risks by integrating advanced AI models and traditional numerical methods. European options are financial derivatives with significant importance in modern financial markets, and accurately pricing these instruments is crucial for effective risk management.

This project will involve developing two types of models:

### Type A: AI-Driven Models <br />
  Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) <br />
  Supervised learning models (e.g., fully connected neural networks) <br />
  Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM) <br />

### Type B: Traditional Numerical Methods <br />
  Monte Carlo Simulation<br />
  Finite Difference Method<br />
  Time series analysis techniques for financial data<br />
  
These approaches will allow for a detailed comparison between state-of-the-art AI models and established traditional models, emphasizing their strengths, weaknesses, and practical applications in real-world scenarios.

## 2. Objectives

Develop a Pricing Model for European Options: 

#### 1.Implement and evaluate both AI-based and traditional numerical methods for pricing European options. 
This includes implementing Black-Scholes as a benchmark model. <br />
#### 2.Risk Management Metrics: 
Calculate Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta, and Rho) to quantify sensitivities and potential risk factors for options portfolios. Both AI and traditional models will be used for sensitivity analysis. <br />
#### 3.Model Comparison and Evaluation: 
Conduct comparative analysis based on: <br />
 . Accuracy of price predictions<br />
 . Computational efficiency (e.g., speed and resource consumption)<br />
 . Scalability to larger datasets or complex market environments<br />
#### 4.GitHub Documentation and Visualization: <br />
Ensure all code, results, and documentation are well-structured for easy navigation on GitHub. Include visualizations to illustrate the performance and comparison of models.

## 3. Methodology

### Type A: AI-Driven Models <br />
#### .PINNs: 
Implement a PINN to solve the Black-Scholes partial differential equation (PDE). PINNs will leverage the known physics underlying the option pricing formula to enhance learning accuracy and stability.<br />
#### .Supervised Learning Models: 
Train supervised neural networks on historical option price data, aiming to approximate the pricing function based on historical volatility, underlying asset price, and other key variables. <br />
#### .LSTM Networks: 
Use LSTM networks for time-series predictions of underlying asset prices, which feed into the option pricing models for more dynamic, forward-looking pricing.<br />
### Type B: Traditional Numerical Methods
#### .Monte Carlo Simulation: 
Develop a Monte Carlo simulation for European options, simulating multiple paths for the underlying asset and averaging the resulting option prices.
#### .Finite Difference Methods: 
Implement finite difference methods to approximate the solution to the Black-Scholes PDE numerically.
#### .Time Series Analysis: 
Apply time series models (e.g., ARIMA, GARCH) to forecast volatility and price trends, enhancing the reliability of traditional option pricing methods.

## 4. Project Structure

The project will be structured as follows:

1. Data Collection & Preprocessing: Acquire historical options data and preprocess for both training and evaluation. Use open datasets (such as Yahoo Finance or Quandl).
2. Model Development:
AI Models (PINNs, Supervised Neural Networks, LSTMs)
Traditional Models (Monte Carlo, Finite Difference, Time Series)
3. Model Comparison: Analyze and compare the performance of AI-based and traditional models in terms of accuracy, computational cost, and reliability.
4. Results Visualization: Create visualizations for price predictions, sensitivity metrics (Greeks), and performance comparison.
5. Documentation and GitHub Portfolio: Ensure all code is modular, well-documented, and complemented with a project overview, model explanations, and instructions for reproducibility.

## 5. Evaluation Metrics

To evaluate the effectiveness of each model, use the following metrics:

#### Pricing Accuracy: 
Measure the error between the predicted and actual option prices.
#### Computational Efficiency: 
Assess the time complexity and memory usage of each model.
#### Risk Management Precision: 
Accuracy in calculating Greeks and other risk metrics.

## 6. Deliverables

#### Codebase: 
Modular, well-documented code with separate folders for data processing, models, and visualization.
#### Documentation: 
Comprehensive README with explanations of model choice, usage instructions, and a summary of findings.
Reports: Detailed analysis and comparison report, highlighting which model performs best under specific conditions.

## 7. Conclusion

This project will contribute to the financial research community by exploring the trade-offs between traditional numerical and AI-driven models for European options pricing and risk management. The GitHub repository will be a resource for practitioners and researchers looking to apply advanced AI techniques or traditional methods to option pricing problems, with reproducible, high-quality code and thorough documentation.
