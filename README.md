# European Options Pricing and Risk Management Using AI-Driven Models and Traditional Numerical Methods
## 1. Project Overview

The aim of this project is to develop a comprehensive solution for pricing European options and managing associated financial risks by integrating advanced AI models and traditional numerical methods. European options are financial derivatives with significant importance in modern financial markets, and accurately pricing these instruments is crucial for effective risk management.

This project will involve developing two types of models:

### Type A: AI-Driven Models <br />
  Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) <br />
  Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM) <br />

### Type B: Traditional Numerical Methods <br />
  Monte Carlo Simulation<br />
  Finite Difference Method<br />
  Time series analysis techniques for financial data<br />
  
These approaches will allow for a detailed comparison between state-of-the-art AI models and established traditional models, emphasizing their strengths, weaknesses, and practical applications in real-world scenarios.

## 2. Objectives

Develop a Pricing Model for European Options: 

#### 1.Combine the traditional numerical methods and RNN for analyzing time serier with PINN and Q-learning for pricing European options. 
This includes implementing Black-Scholes as a benchmark model. <br />
##### 1.a. Finding trends, seasonality and forcasting using ARIMA models,
Download, preprocess the data, and try to forecast the future Stock prices. Asses the validity of ARIMA models. <br />
##### 1.b. Use Recurrent Neural Nets for stock price forecasting.
We will specifically use LSTM and GRU models.
##### 1.c. Check for volatility clustering.
Check whether the volatilities are propagating in time or they are just constants. This data used in geometrical Brownian motion to provide the third way for stock price forecasting. <br />
#### 2.Risk Management Metrics and Implied Volatility using PINN: 
Calculate Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta, and Rho) to quantify sensitivities and potential risk factors for options portfolios. <br />
#### 3.Implement the Fitted Q-Itteration for finding fair option price: 
The works of Igor Halberin (arXiv:1712.04609) is used to find the effect of volatility backpropagation in Option pricing. <br/>
#### 4.GitHub Documentation and Visualization: <br />
Ensure all code, results, and documentation are well-structured for easy navigation on GitHub. Include visualizations to illustrate the performance and comparison of models.

## 3. Methodology

### Type A: AI-Driven Models <br />
#### .PINNs: 
Implement a PINN to solve the Black-Scholes partial differential equation (PDE). PINNs will leverage the known physics underlying the option pricing formula to enhance learning accuracy and stability. In addition, one can use PINN's inverse parameter solving methods to find the implied volatility. On the other hand, PINN can be used to solve Black-Sholdes equation for non-constant paramters. <br />
#### .RNN Networks: 
Use RNN networks (LSTM and GRU layers) for time-series predictions of underlying asset prices, which feed into the option pricing models for more dynamic, forward-looking pricing.<br />
### Type B: Traditional Numerical Methods
#### .Monte Carlo Simulation: 
Develop a Monte Carlo simulation for European options, simulating multiple paths for the underlying asset and averaging the resulting option prices.
#### .Time Series Analysis: 
Apply time series models (e.g., ARIMA, GARCH) to forecast volatility and price trends, enhancing the reliability of traditional option pricing methods.

## 4. Project Structure

The project will be structured as follows:

1. Data Collection & Preprocessing: Acquire historical options data and preprocess for both training and evaluation. Use open datasets (such as Yahoo Finance).
2. Model Development:
AI Models (PINNs, RNNs, Q-learning)
Traditional Models (Monte Carlo, Finite Difference, Time Series)

4. Results Visualization: Create visualizations for price predictions, sensitivity metrics (Greeks), and performance comparison.
5. Documentation and GitHub Portfolio: Ensure all code is modular, well-documented, and complemented with a project overview, model explanations, and instructions for reproducibility.

## 5. Evaluation Metrics

To evaluate the effectiveness of each model, use the following metrics:

#### Pricing Accuracy: 
Measure the error between the predicted and actual option prices.
#### Computational Efficiency: 
Assess the time complexity and memory usage of each model.
#### Risk Management Precision: 
Accuracy in calculating Greeks and other risk metrics.

## 6. Deliverables

#### Codebase: 
Modular, well-documented code with separate folders for data processing, models, and visualization.
#### Documentation: 
Comprehensive README with explanations of model choice, usage instructions, and a summary of findings.
Reports: Detailed analysis and comparison report, highlighting which model performs best under specific conditions.

## 7. Conclusion

This project will contribute to the financial research community by exploring the trade-offs between traditional numerical and AI-driven models for European options pricing and risk management. The GitHub repository will be a resource for practitioners and researchers looking to apply advanced AI techniques or traditional methods to option pricing problems, with reproducible, high-quality code and thorough documentation.
